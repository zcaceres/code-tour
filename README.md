# Code Tour
## Onboard Engineers without Docs

`code-tour` is a tiny program to introduce new engineers to a project's structure and patterns.

## Why?
External docs are a hidden dependency in applications. They are unavoidable, but hard to keep in sync since nothing in the code indicates the dependency.

`code-tour` shares knowledge typically contained in docs, but located within the code itself.
